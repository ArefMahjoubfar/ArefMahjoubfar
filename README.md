# Hi, I'm Aref Mahjoubfar üëã  

I'm a medical doctor with a strong passion for research in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Medical AI Applications** üè•, and automation ü§ñ.  

## My Journey  

My fascination with technology began in childhood, when I started designing websites using Joomla and WordPress, as well as building custom websites from scratch. As I grew older, I explored application development with C#, further deepening my interest in software and automation.  

During my medical education, I teamed up with a group of friends (**EN.SAF** üòò as *Fairness* in Persian) to explore machine learning with a focus on computer vision in medical practice. This led to a thesis project that involved diagnosing **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** and **Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML)** through the analysis of blood and bone marrow slide images, with a dataset we collected over the span of one year. Over time, I honed my skills in Python üêç and worked extensively with machine learning libraries like **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. More recently, I've expanded into Natural Language Processing and working with Large Language Models, actively designing models and utilizing tools such as **LangChain** to push the boundaries of Medical AI.  

## My Vision  

Life moves on, and I'm genuinely excited about the future and the next wave of technological innovations (*my ultimate goal of immortality!* üòâ). I firmly believe in open science and the importance of combining our efforts step by step to lay down the foundations for tomorrow's breakthroughs. Let's keep learning, innovating, and making strides towards a better future together!
